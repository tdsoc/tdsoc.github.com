        <p>Wellcome to <em>The dark side of Cryptography</em>!</p>

<p>This page is under construcion, in a few weeks here you will find our activities and active projects... Come back soon!</p>

<h3>Who are we?</h3>

<p>We are a newly-born group of mathematicians, hackers, and cryptographers who are devolving their time and minds to the open source and to the dark side of cryptography, with the aim of developing new tools for applying state-of-the-art cryptanalysis algorithms to real life situations, in order to sensitize the community <em>always</em> to use new-generation and not-broken cryptographic tools.</p>

<h3>CryptoLabTN</h3>

<p>
  The dark side of cryptography was born in January 2013, as an dissemination activity of the laboratory of cryptography
  and industrial mathematics, Department of Mathematics, University of Trento.
  CryptoLabTN cohordinates the academic effort of the TDSoC, together with other universities, mainly proposing
  cryptoanalytic attacks to implement and verify. A group of of yung enthusiasts participate freely in the TDSoC, taking
  parts in the projects they like.
</p>


<h3>Projects of the TDSoC</h3>

<p>
  The current projects are:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Attacks on weak RSA keys
      </li>
      <li>
        Attack on reduced versions of AES up to 6 rounds
      </li>
    </ul>
    
  The establishment of the new projects follows the guide lines of the TDSoC policies. Ideally, the projects come
  from publish papers or academic theses.
