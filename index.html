		Welcome to <em>The Dark Side Of Cryptography</em>!
	</p>

	<h3>
		Who are we?
	</h3>

	<p>
		We are a newly-born group of hackers, cryptographers and mathematicians
		who are devolving their time and minds to the open source and to the dark side of cryptography.
		Our plan is to develop new code which actually implements state-of-the-art cryptanalysis algorithms
		(which are often left in the realm of theoretical publications).
		Our aim is to sensitize the community <em>always</em> to use
		new-generation and unbroken cryptographic tools.</p>

	<h3>
		CryptoLabTN
	</h3>

	<p>
		The Dark Side Of Cryptography (TDSoC) idea was born in January 2013,
		as a dissemination activity of the laboratory of cryptography
		and industrial mathematics, Department of Mathematics, University of Trento.
		CryptoLabTN will coordinate the academic effort of the TDSoC, together with other universities,
		and it will give some starting code material developed during thesis and research work.
		A group of of young enthusiasts early on took up the challenge
		and decided to participate in the TDSoC according to their skills and preferences.
