Come back soon!\r\n\r\n### Who are we?\r\nWe are a newly-born group of mathematicians, hackers, and cryptographers who are devolving their time and minds to the open source and to the dark side of cryptography, with the aim of developing new tools for applying state-of-the-art cryptanalysis algorithms to real life situations, in order to sensitize the community _always_ to use new-generation and not-broken cryptographic tools.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
