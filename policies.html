		How to propose a new projec
	</h3>
	<p>
		Any project proposal should be submitted to the Academic Board of the TDSoC
		who decides of the acceptance of the new projects. To be accepted, the new
		project must meet four conditions:
		<ul>
			<li>
				it must be the implemetation of published attacks on some cryptosystem,
				including published papers, master theses, PhD theses, etc...
			</li>
			<li>
				the cryptoanalytic algorithms must be free of any royaltes, generally speaking
				must be freely implementable and exploitable
			</li>
			<li>
				the cryptosystem under attack must be of some practical interest (e.g.: 
				recognized standard such as RSA, AES and E0)
			</li>
			<li>
				the attack must be feasible, that is once implemented, it should run in
				reasonable time with commonly available hardware (e.g.: one month on a 12 cores
				server)
			</li>

		</ul>
